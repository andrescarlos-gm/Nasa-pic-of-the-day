# NASA PICTURE OF THE DAY

<a href="url"><img src="/nasalogo.png"></a>

This script allows you to daily download NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day from the API and set it as your background image. It's a feature that I really love from Ubuntu.

You can run the script by simply pasting it into a PowerShell window.

### To Do

* Improve comments and algorithm structure
* Run Bat - Ps1 scripts in the background, hidden
* Directly execute the ps1 file from the task, no need to instantiate it from a .bat
